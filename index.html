             <h2>GOVERNMENT POLYTECHNIC CHOPAN SONBHADRA</h2>
              <p> Established in 2016, Government Polytechnic Chopan, Sonbhadra has rapidly emerged as a key government institution dedicated to technical education in Uttar Pradesh.<br> 
                Affiliated with the Board of Technical Education, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, the institute embodies the state’s vision of empowering youth through quality engineering and technology education.<br><br> 
                The institute was founded to expand technical education opportunities in the Sonbhadra region, an area previously lacking sufficient higher educational infrastructure.<br> 
                Initially, academic activities began at the Government Polytechnic Sonbhadra campus in Lodhi, Robertsganj, while the permanent facilities in Chopan were being developed.<br> 
                From the outset, the institute has focused on creating an environment that nurtures academic excellence and practical skills.<br><br>
                 Government Polytechnic Chopan offers three core diploma programs: Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics Engineering, and Automobile Engineering.<br>
                  These programs are designed to equip students with foundational knowledge and industry-relevant skills, following a curriculum approved by the Board of Technical Education, Uttar Pradesh.<br>
                   This ensures graduates are well-prepared for critical and evolving engineering fields.<br><br> The Computer Science program emphasizes programming, software development, and networking, preparing students for IT and software roles.<br>
                    Electronics Engineering covers electronic circuits, communication systems, and embedded technology, catering to telecommunications and automation industries.<br>
                     The Automobile Engineering diploma focuses on vehicle design, manufacturing, and maintenance, addressing the demands of a rapidly advancing automotive sector.<br><br> 
                     The institute strongly promotes inclusivity and hands-on learning.<br> With experienced faculty, modern labs, and regular workshops and industry visits, students gain practical experience and exposure to current industry trends.<br><br> 
                     Collaborations with industry and government initiatives like “Skill India” ensure that training aligns with national development goals.<br> Graduates emerge not only job-ready but also capable of innovation and sustainable contributions.<br><br>
                      Government Polytechnic Chopan has earned a respected reputation in Uttar Pradesh for quality education and remains committed to expanding and evolving its offerings to meet future challenges.<br>

        <div class="message"> <h4>PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</h4>
           <p> When learning is purposeful, creativity blossoms.<br>
             When creativity blossoms, thoughtful thinking emerges.<br>
              When thinking flourishes, knowledge shines brightly.”<br>
               — Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam<br><br> 
               At Government Polytechnic Chopan (GPCS), 
               we firmly believe that graduating is not the final goal—it is a step toward lifelong education.<br>
                True education is not measured by how much you memorize or how much information you acquire.<br> 
                Instead, it is about how effectively you can apply that knowledge in real-world situations after gaining technical education.<br>
                 Our mission is to empower students to transform their learning into practical skills that drive innovation and progress.<br> </p> </div>
